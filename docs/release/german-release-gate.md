# German Release Gate — PHASE 87L.6G

**Branch:** `phase-87l6-german-localization`
**Baseline:** `7e0405c` (PHASE 87L.6F)
**Status of this document: PREPARATION ONLY.** Nothing here has been committed,
merged or deployed, and no item below may be marked complete on the strength of
this file alone.

---

## 1. Orphan namespace register (§13 — documented, NOT removed)

Three catalog namespaces are fully translated into German but have **no direct
consumer**. They are preserved deliberately: deleting a namespace is a separate,
riskier change than translating one, and the catalog parity tests treat all
three locales as one shape.

| Namespace | Leaves | Direct consumer | Superseded by | Compatibility references | Removal risk | Proposed cleanup |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| `platform` | 12 | **none** — `grep` for `useTranslations("platform")` / `getTranslations("platform")` / `"platform.` returns zero binding sites | `publicSite.platform.*` — `/[locale]/platform/page.tsx` reads `getTranslations("publicSite")` then `t("platform.eyebrow")` etc. | 3-way key-parity tests (`de-catalog.test.ts`), full-catalog reconciliation (`german-final-gate.test.ts`) | **Low.** No runtime reader. Removal must delete the key from **en, fa and de together** or parity tests fail. | Dedicated catalog-pruning phase |
| `analytics` | 15 | **none** — `AssetAnalyticsClient` binds `useTranslations("assetOperations")` and reads `analytics.*` from **that** namespace | `assetOperations.analytics.*` | as above | **Low**, same parity caveat | Dedicated catalog-pruning phase |
| `automation` | 19 | **none** — every `/automation` page and component binds `useTranslations("automationOperations")` | `automationOperations.*` | as above; `automation-operations-extraction.test.ts` asserts the *live* namespace, not this one | **Low–medium.** 8 of the 19 leaves are status labels (`active`, `paused`, `draft`, …). The live UI renders the raw UPPERCASE enum instead, so reviving them would need the `t.has()` fallback pattern already used for `triggerLabels`. | Dedicated catalog-pruning phase |

**Do not delete or rename these in this phase.** They are counted in the
5,136-leaf reconciliation as real German translations, because they are.

## 2. Known org-level API observation (NOT changed in this phase)

Distinct from the app-level Role axis closed in 87L.6G, the **organization**
RBAC matrix in `src/lib/org/rbac.ts` grants:

```
view_api_keys: ["OWNER", "ADMIN", "MANAGER", "ENGINEER", "BILLING_ADMIN"]
```

So an org member whose **organization role** is `ENGINEER` may still LIST API
keys and their scopes through `/api/platform/keys` (never the secret — that is
one-time display at creation). This is a deliberate Phase-33 decision, on a
different axis from the app-level `engineer` Role, and changing it would alter
behaviour for every organization. **Owner decision required** — it is reported,
not silently flipped.

`manage_api_keys` (create / revoke / rotate) correctly excludes `ENGINEER`.

## 3. Human German review checklist (§14)

Reviewer profile required: **native German-speaking industrial engineer**
(automation / electrical / maintenance) for the engineering content; a native
German commercial reviewer for billing/CRM wording.

Supporting artefacts already produced:
- `docs/i18n/german-knowledge-review.md` — 30-article safety-critical review sheet
- `docs/i18n/german-glossary.md` — terminology decisions

## 4. Authenticated browser validation matrix (§15)

**Not executed.** No authenticated session of any role was available in the
build environment, and no test accounts were created or fabricated. This matrix
is the plan a human runs; every "Actual" cell is empty by design.

Expected values below are derived from the shared policy
(`src/lib/auth/roles.ts` + `src/lib/auth/rbac.ts`) and are what the run should
confirm — not evidence that it did.

Legend: **A** = renders, **D** = denied (`RequireCapability` denial state),
**R** = redirected to `/{locale}/auth/login?from=…`

### 4.1 Expected access per role

| Route | Engineer | Admin | Superadmin | Anonymous |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/{loc}/dashboard` | A | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/assets` | A | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/cmms` | A | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/documents` | A | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/automation` | A | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/industrial-brain` | A | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/dashboard/copilot` | A | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/dashboard/predictive` | A | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/crm` | **D/R** | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/erp` | **D/R** | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/dashboard/billing` | **D/R** | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/dashboard/organization` | **D/R** | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/dashboard/api` | **D/R** | A | A | R |
| `/{loc}/admin` | **D/R** | A | A | R |

### 4.2 Run grid — 3 roles × 3 locales × 14 routes

For **each** role ∈ {Engineer, Admin, Superadmin} and **each** locale ∈ {fa, en, de},
walk all 14 routes above and record:

| Field | What to record |
|---|---|
| Expected access | from the table in 4.1 |
| Actual status | HTTP status / rendered outcome |
| Redirect or denial behaviour | exact destination URL, and whether `from=` preserves the locale |
| Navigation visibility | is the link present in the sidebar for this role? |
| Console errors | count + first message |
| Hydration errors | any React hydration warning |
| Horizontal overflow | `documentElement.scrollWidth > innerWidth` at 320 / 375 / 768 / desktop |
| Unauthorized API requests | any 401/403 fired by the page itself |
| Notification polling | any `/api/notifications*` request while signed out |

### 4.3 Specific assertions the human run must confirm

1. Engineer signed in on `/de`: sidebar shows **no** Billing, Organization,
   API Platform, CRM, ERP or Admin entry.
2. Engineer typing `/de/dashboard/billing` directly is denied — not merely
   hidden in the nav.
3. The denial is **localized German**, not English fallback.
4. Switching locale while on a denied route does not grant access.
5. A `from=` value pointing at a denied route does not authorize it after login.
6. Admin and Superadmin reach all 14 routes in all three locales.
7. Anonymous on any protected route lands on the **same-locale** login page.
8. No notification polling occurs on public German pages.

## 5. Release blockers still open

| # | Item | Owner | Blocking merge? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Native German review of all surfaces in §3 | German reviewer | **Yes, for publishing German** |
| 2 | Authenticated browser matrix in §4 executed | QA / owner | **Yes** |
| 3 | Org-level `view_api_keys` includes `ENGINEER` (§2 above) | Product owner | Decision required |
| 4 | Orphan namespace cleanup (§1) | Engineering | No — documented, deferred |

Nothing in this phase has been committed, pushed, merged or deployed.
